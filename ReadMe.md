Summary Report - Technology implementation

In this project, I implemented the technology of ASP.Net Core version 6.0. I designed the database in SQL server, which was the key element to sustain the relationships between all the entities created on this application and to keep the traceability of information and a comprehensive functionality between all modules proposed.
I based the development of my application on the following technologies:

• ASP.NET Core - Development Environment Setup (Imported the NuGets for version 6.0 to support the modeling, controlling, and viewing of the application)
• Creating an ASP.Net Core Project and Structure of an ASP.Net Core Project
• Developing ASP.Net Core MVC (Created models out of the database tables along with relationships) • Creating Web API for CRUD Operations on each controller as required• Consuming Web API in ASP.Net Core MVC • Configuring Dependency Injection with Web API • ASP.Net Core – Middleware to configure the program file which requires extra configurations to run the application such as database connection, routing, and deployment.
• Deploying an ASP.Net Core MVC Application.
